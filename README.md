Organisation Overview



Name: M’s Beauty Bar

History: Founded in 2024, M’s Beauty Bar was established to serve Johannesburg’s students and young professionals with stylish, affordable grooming solutions. The salon combines professional beauty care with a youthful, cost-conscious approach.



Mission and Vision



Mission: To empower youth through affordable, high-quality beauty services that uplift confidence and image.

Vision: To be the most trusted, youth-friendly salon in Johannesburg, blending affordability with fashion-forward care.



Target Audience



Students and young professionals aged 18–30 in Braamfontein.



Current Analysis



Research shows that 73% of young South Africans use the internet to search for personal care services (Statista, 2023). Despite this, M’s Beauty Bar relies only on word-of-mouth marketing. Competitors like Sorbet and Dream Nails have well-developed online booking systems, putting M’s Beauty at a disadvantage.



Goals and Objectives



Build an SEO-friendly website to enhance digital presence.



Increase online bookings by 50% within 6 months.



Foster customer trust with reviews and feedback tools.



Proposed Website Features \& Functionality



Homepage: Service highlights, promotions, student discounts.



Booking System: Calendar integration with reminders.



Gallery: Before-and-after transformations.



Reviews: Customer feedback to increase trust.



Contact Page: Map, enquiry form, WhatsApp integration.



Design Aesthetic



Youthful and vibrant using pastel pinks, whites, and gold. Mobile-first responsive design.



Wireframes



Homepage: Hero image + highlights.



Booking Page: Calendar widget + form.



Gallery Page: Grid of photos.



Technical Requirements



HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap; WordPress CMS for flexibility; SSL security; SEO optimization.



Content \& Research Sourcing



Content will be created using customer interviews, salon service menus, and visual media. Market data from Statista and local competitors will shape SEO keywords.



Timeline \& Milestones



Week 1–2: Requirements gathering, competitor research.



Week 3–4: Wireframes and design mockups.



Week 5–6: Front-end development (HTML/CSS/JS).



Week 7: Booking system integration.



Week 8: Testing (mobile + desktop).



Week 9: SEO optimization \& launch.



Week 10: Post-launch evaluation.



Expected Outcomes: Increased bookings, better brand recognition, and a stronger youth following.
